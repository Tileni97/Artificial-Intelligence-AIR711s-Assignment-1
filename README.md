Artificial Intelligence (AIR711s) Assignment 1
This repository contains solutions for the AIR711s Artificial Intelligence Assignment 1, focusing on pathfinding and optimization problems.

Question 1: Robot Navigation System

Objective: Develop a navigation system for a home cleaning robot to efficiently clean a rectangular environment with obstacles.
Approach:
Model the environment using a grid-based map.
Define states and actions for the robot.
Implement the A* search algorithm to find the optimal path.
Design cost and heuristic functions, considering factors like terrain and obstacles.
Visualize the environment, planned path, and cleaning progress.
Question 2: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

Objective: Help a traveling salesman find the most efficient route to visit multiple locations and return to the starting point, minimizing travel distance.
Approach:
Represent the problem using an adjacency matrix or list.
Implement the hill climbing algorithm to find a good (not necessarily optimal) solution.
Analyze the algorithm's time complexity and compare its results to the optimal solution.
Visualize the city set and the routes generated by the algorithm.
Key Concepts:

A* Search Algorithm: Informed search algorithm used for finding the shortest path in a graph.
Heuristic Function: A function that estimates the cost of reaching the goal from a given state, guiding the search algorithm.
Hill Climbing Algorithm: Local search algorithm that iteratively improves a solution by making small changes.
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): A classic optimization problem of finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of locations exactly once and returns to the origin.
Implementation:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: matplotlib, networkx
